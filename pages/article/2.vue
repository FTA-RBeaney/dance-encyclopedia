            Lindy hopper Jerry Almonte sent along a clip of the first
            place-winning routine in a division at the European Swing Dance
            Championships. Lindy hop is a partner dance invented by African
            American youth in Harlem dancing to swing music in the early 1930s.
            It&rsquo;s near and dear to my heart; I&rsquo;ve been a lindy hopper
            for 13 years (minus that year with a broken leg).
          </p>

          <p>
            Modern day lindy hop raises difficult questions. In a post I wrote
            when the beloved Frankie Manning died, titled Race, Entertainment,
            and Historical Borrowing, I tried to capture the conundrum.
            I&rsquo;m going to quote myself extensively, only because this is a
            tricky issue that deserves real discussion:
          </p>

          <p>
            Though lindy hop was invented by African Americans, lindy hoppers
            today are primarily white. These contemporary dancers look to old
            movie clips of famous black dancers as inspiration. And this is
            where things get interesting: The old clips feature profoundly
            talented black dancers, but the context in which they are dancing is
            important. Professional black musicians, choreographers, and dancers
            had to make the same concessions that other black entertainers at
            the time made. That is, they were required to capitulate to white
            producers and directors who presented black people to white
            audiences. These movies portrayed black people in ways that white
            people were comfortable with: blacks were musical, entertaining,
            athletic (even animalistic), outrageous (even wild), not-so-smart,
            happy-go-lucky, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            So what we see in the old clips that contemporary lindy hoppers
            idolize is not a pure manifestation of lindy hop, but a
            manifestation of the dance infused by racism. While lindy hoppers
            today look at those old clips with nothing short of reverance, they
            are mostly naive to the fact that the dancing they are emulating was
            a product made to confirm white people&rsquo;s beliefs about black
            people.
          </p>

          <p>&#8230;</p>

          <p>
            So we have a set of (mostly) white dancers who (mostly) naively and
            (always) wholeheartedly emulate a set of black dancers whose
            performances, now 70 to 80 years old, were produced for mostly white
            audiences and adjusted according to the racial ethos of the time. On
            the one hand, it&rsquo;s neat that the dance is still alive;
            it&rsquo;s wonderful to see it embodied, and with so much
            enthusiasm, so many years later. And certainly no ill will can be
            fairly attributed to today&rsquo;s dancers. On the other hand,
            it&rsquo;s troubling that the dance was appropriated then (for white
            audiences) and that it is that appropriation that lives on (for
            mostly white dancers). Then again, without those dancers, there
            would likely be no revival at all. And without those clips, however
            imperfect, the dance might have remained in obscurity, lost with the
            bodies of the original dancers.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is this paradox that stirred Jerry to send along the clip of Dax
            Hock and Sarah Breck performing a routine that was an homage to a
            famous clip from the movie Day at the Races, featuring
            Whitey&rsquo;s Lindy Hoppers. Here&rsquo;s the original clip from
            1937:
          </p>

          <p>
            And here&rsquo;s Dax and Sarah&rsquo;s routine (Dax, btw, is in a
            fat suit; an entirely different and equally troublesome issue):
          </p>

          <p></p>

          <p>
            To be as clear as possible, I do believe 100% that Dax and Sarah
            have no intention to mock and, as essentially professional lindy
            hoppers, I doubt very much that they&rsquo;ve never considered the
            ideas I&rsquo;ve explained above.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dax and Sarah are not my target here and, besides, they&rsquo;re
            just two people. All conscious lindy hoppers struggle with these
            issues. My target, and my own personal struggle, is the entire
            endeavor.
          </p>

          <p>
            I leave this as an open question for discussion, and one that
            extends far beyond lindy hop to jazz, blues, rap, and hip hop music;
            other forms of dance, like break dancing and pop and locking; and
            even the American obsession with spectating sports that are
            currently dominated by black athletes. It also extends far past the
            relationship between blacks and whites, as Adrienne Keene well
            illustrates in her blog, Native Appropriations.
          </p>

          <p>
            How do white people, especially when they&rsquo;re more or less on
            their racial own, honor art forms invented by oppressed racial
            groups without &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; them from those that invented
            them, misrepresenting them, or honoring them in ways that reproduce
            racism? You tell me&#8230; &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;d like to know.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more, I&rsquo;d be thrilled if you read my original post,
            inspired by the passing of Frankie Manning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also worth considering is this beautiful music video (Slow Club, Two
            Cousins) featuring lindy hoppers Ryan Francoise and Remy Kouakou
            Kouame performing vintage jazz movement. Is it different? What makes
            it so (other than production value and the race of the dancers)? Can
            you articulate it? Or is it tacit knowledge?
